    <h1>Extras</h1>
    <p>
      How many times have you ignored the person on the street asking for money even though you know you have a five in your pocket? My mind wanders to any excuse for my deservingness of the change I hold. Whether it be that I’m a university student who has bar tabs to pay, or if my money would be better spent being put into stocks, so that one day I’ll have enough disposable income to offer to men on the street. Whatever I land on, whatever gives me the satisfaction of knowing that the money I hold is happier in my own wallet is one of the white lies I tell myself every day so that I may live in pride. Money I am not so easily willing to part with, my attention, however, is rather promiscuous. When I find someone so confident in their words, I might as well be chained to the floor. I imagine that just as I hold a desire to listen, there are many men on the street who hold an equally strong desire to be heard.
