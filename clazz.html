    <p>Mexico is right on the edge of legalizing marijuana. Protests occur nearly everyday in Mexico City, where young men march around the senate
      building with joints in their mouths. There are two places in the city where marijuana is currently de facto,
        the largest, a place called Planton 420, is on the corner of Reforma and Insurgentes and right next to the senate building. Down Insurgentes a few minutes there is
         another much smaller collection of marijuana plants cared for by a few passionate dwellers. Although, not everyone is
        radically protesting the laws, most people who find themselves at one of these two refuges are simply just looking for a place to smoke a dooobie and
        pass the time with some friends.</p>
         <p>I spent some time talking to most of the people photographed here. Most were just hanging out or selling some weed on a free afternoon. Others were a bit more
         involved, however. Luis, the young man photographed inside the tent has been living at the small marijuana refuge on Insurgentes for the last six months.
       He tends to a few plants, sells a little bit of it, and keeps the place peaceful. There are signs around the encampment signaling for people to keep quiet after certain hours
     and others that offer prices for germinated marijuana sprouts. Luis says the place tends to stay quite calm. There is usually a group of 20-30 people hanging out
   in the area, or maybe just stopping by to smoke before they get on their way.</p>
